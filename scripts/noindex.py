"""Mark the pages that exist to be arrived at, not to be found.

Two pages here are answers to something that already happened rather than
destinations in their own right: the 404, which answers an address that does not
resolve, and the confirmation after the contact form, which answers a message
already sent. Ranking either would put a visitor on a page whose entire content
is about an event that did not happen to them.

The generator writes its own robots meta and ignores a `robots:` key in the
front matter, so this is done to the built page rather than declared in the
source. Removing them from the sitemap is not done by name anywhere: a page
marked noindex should not be listed, so check-sitemap.py reads the mark back out
of the built HTML. The rule has one place to live and the two cannot drift.
