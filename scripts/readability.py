"""Score the readability of the built site.

Prose on a standards site drifts towards the standard's own register: long
sentences, nouns stacked on nouns, and a reader who gives up. This measures it
instead of arguing about it, using the two scores that have an agreed formula.

    Flesch Reading Ease  = 206.835 - 1.015 * (words/sentence) - 84.6 * (syllables/word)
    Flesch-Kincaid Grade = 0.39 * (words/sentence) + 11.8 * (syllables/word) - 15.59

What is scored, and what is not
-------------------------------
Each page is scored on its own prose: the hero lead and the body. Navigation,
the footer and the assurance band are identical on all 2,853 pages, so counting
them would measure the template rather than the page, and would drag every score
towards the same number.

Code blocks, inline code and tables are removed before scoring. `pacs.008.001.10`
is not a word, its full stops are not sentence endings, and leaving it in makes
the arithmetic meaningless.

Headings are scored as sentences of their own. They are read, so they count, but
they rarely end in a full stop and would otherwise be glued onto the sentence
that follows.
