"""Every page that should be in the sitemap is, and nothing else is.

A page missing from the sitemap is a page a crawler has to find by following a
link to it, and with 2,845 message pages that is exactly the tail that does not
get found. So the count is checked rather than trusted.

Counting alone was what this did, in the workflow rather than here, and counting
alone has a blind spot: it compares two totals and is satisfied when they agree,
so a page dropped and a page wrongly added cancel out. It also had no way to
express a page that is deliberately absent. The 404 is one — it answers for
addresses that do not exist and is marked noindex, so listing it would invite a
crawler to index a page whose entire content is "that page is not here" — and
adding it broke the check the first time it ran.

Comparing the two sets rather than their sizes says which page, in which
direction, and lets the one deliberate exclusion be named as such.
