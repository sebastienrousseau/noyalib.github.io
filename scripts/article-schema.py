"""Give news articles a byline and mark them as NewsArticle.

The generator emits WebSite, Organization and WebPage for every page, which says
a page exists but not what kind of thing it is, who stands behind it, or what it
is based on. For a news article those three are the whole point.

An assistant answering "did Swift move the structured address deadline" has to
decide which of several pages to quote and whom to credit. A WebPage node gives
it a title and a date. A NewsArticle node gives it a headline, a named author, a
publisher and — through `isBasedOn` and `citation` — the primary source the piece
is reporting on, so the claim can be traced past this site to Swift's own
announcement. That is the difference between being read and being cited.

Everything is read back out of the built page. Structured data that disagrees
with the visible text is worse than none: it is grounds for a manual penalty, and
a second hand-maintained copy of a headline drifts the moment somebody edits one.

The byline is the visible half of the same claim. An article whose authorship
exists only in metadata asks a reader to take it on trust and gives an assistant
nothing to corroborate; the Person node carries the same name with links to where
that person can be checked, so the expertise can be validated from more than one
source rather than asserted here.
