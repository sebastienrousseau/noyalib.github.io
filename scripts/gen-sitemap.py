"""Write sitemap.xml from the pages that were actually built.

ssg emits a sitemap whose contents depend on its incremental cache: a clean
build produces an empty <urlset> and a per-page sitemap in every directory,
while a rebuild over an existing output aggregates them into the root. CI
always builds clean, so the deployed sitemap listed nothing at all — 2,845
pages published and none discoverable.

Deriving it from the built output instead makes it independent of cache state,
which is the property a sitemap needs: it should describe what was published,
and nothing else can tell you that as reliably as looking at what was
published.
