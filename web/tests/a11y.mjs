// WCAG 2.2 AA audit with axe-core, in a real browser.
//
// The generator ships an accessibility checker and it runs on every build, but
// it reads the markup. A whole class of AA failure only exists once the page is
// rendered: colour contrast depends on what the cascade actually resolved, focus
// order depends on layout, and a control hidden by CSS is a different thing from
// one hidden by an attribute. This drives the built pages in Chrome and asks
// axe-core, which is what WAVE and the other auditors are built on.
//
// Every combination of what the system asks for and what the visitor chose.
// Those are independent: a stylesheet that switches on prefers-color-scheme
// alone is correct until somebody on a light system chooses dark, at which
// point its colours and the site's disagree. That combination shipped a
// contrast ratio of 1.04 on code blocks, and this test missed it because it
// only ever set the theme attribute — inheriting whatever the machine running
// it happened to prefer.
//
//   make a11y-axe
//
// Needs puppeteer-core, axe-core and a Chrome; the make target skips rather
// than fails when they are absent.

// benefit, so the phone width runs the two system preferences and no explicit
// choice, which is what the overwhelming majority of visitors are in.

// axe reports three outcomes, not two, and the third is where a real failure
// hid. A contrast ratio of exactly 1:1 is filed as "incomplete" rather than as
// a violation, because at 1:1 axe cannot tell text deliberately hidden behind
// its own background from a button whose label has vanished. This suite read
// only `violations`, so it called a nav CTA with an invisible label green.
//
// So incomplete results are failures too, with two exceptions that axe cannot
// decide and no cascade bug can hide behind:
//
//   - a background it could not resolve because a pseudo element paints it,
//     which is every heading over a banner scrim;
//   - a background it could not resolve because something overlaps the element.
//     This one only appears in CI, on prose that this Chrome measures at 17.23
//     against the same page, so it is a difference in what the two browsers can
//     resolve rather than a difference in the page;
//   - an element whose content is only non-text characters, which is a table
//     cell holding an em dash.
//
// Anything else — above all a message quoting a ratio axe measured and then
// declined to rule on — fails. An unrecognised message fails as well, so a new
// class of deferral has to be looked at rather than passing unseen.
// Every one of these says axe could not compute a ratio. None of them carries a
// ratio it computed and then declined to rule on — that is the case this suite
// exists to catch, and it stays a failure.
